# OpenTerrainGenerator

OpenTerrainGenerator is a fully customizable world generation mod/plugin for Forge and Spigot. Through its various configuration files it gives the user control over almost every aspect of Minecraft's world generation, allowing you to generate anything from floating islands to cave worlds with no knowledge of Java required. OTG is just an engine, to make use of its functions you must either install a World Preset (see Installing Worlds) or make your own custom World Preset (see Configuration below or in Navigation bar at the top). OTG supports both Spigot (servers) and Forge (servers and single-player).

## Main Features

* Control horizontal and vertical noise, terrain height and volatility
* Create new biomes and control the size of biomes, islands and continents
* Import custom trees and other objects (BO2 and BO3)
* Control over mob spawning rules and climate settings per biome
